# OnesToManys Project - Week-Long Learning Overview

## Project Introduction

Welcome to the **OnesToManys** project - a comprehensive week-long journey that will take your students from database design fundamentals to full-stack web development. This project is designed to give students hands-on experience building a complete 3-tier web application while mastering the critical concept of master-detail (one-to-many) relationships in data modeling.

## What Students Will Learn

### **Core Learning Objectives**

By the end of this week, students will have gained practical experience in:

**Database Design & Management**
- Understanding and implementing master-detail relationships in relational databases
- Creating database schemas using SQL DDL statements
- Generating synthetic test data for development and testing
- Working with foreign keys and referential integrity constraints
- Understanding cascade operations and data consistency

**Backend Development**
- Building RESTful APIs using either Java (Spring Framework) or Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- Implementing full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Designing API endpoints that properly represent hierarchical data relationships
- Managing database connections and transactions
- Understanding 3-tier architecture principles (Presentation, Business Logic, Data layers)

**API Design & Testing**
- Creating intuitive REST endpoint structures for master-detail relationships
- Using command-line tools (curl) for basic API testing
- Working with GUI-based API testing tools (Postman, Insomnia, or Everest)
- Understanding HTTP methods and status codes
- Implementing data serialization and deserialization

**Frontend Development**
- Building user interfaces with Vanilla JavaScript
- Creating dynamic React applications
- Connecting frontend applications to backend APIs
- Designing user-friendly interfaces for hierarchical data navigation
- Implementing client-side CRUD operations

**Data Management**
- Importing and exporting data in multiple formats (SQL, JSON)
- Understanding data persistence strategies
- Working with database dumps and data migration

## **Project Structure & Timeline**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2)**
- Project planning and relationship modeling
- Database schema design and implementation
- SQL file creation with DDL statements
- Synthetic data generation and loading

### **Phase 2: Backend Development (Days 3-4)**
- REST API server creation
- CRUD endpoint implementation for both master and detail entities
- One-to-many relationship API endpoints
- Comprehensive API testing using multiple tools

### **Phase 3: Frontend Integration (Days 5-7)**
- Vanilla JavaScript client development
- React application creation
- User interface design for master-detail data management
- Dynamic data visualization and interaction

## **Real-World Application**

Students will choose from practical business scenarios such as:
- **Customer-Orders** management systems
- **Course-Students** enrollment tracking
- **Blog-Comments** content management
- **Playlist-Songs** media organization
- **Project-Tasks** workflow management

These scenarios mirror real-world development challenges and provide context for understanding why master-detail relationships are fundamental to modern application development.

## **Technical Skills Development**

**For Java Track Students:**
- Spring Boot framework proficiency
- JPA/Hibernate ORM concepts
- Spring Data REST implementation
- Maven project management

**For Python Track Students:**
- Flask or FastAPI framework usage
- SQLAlchemy ORM concepts
- Python web development patterns
- Package management with pip

**Universal Skills:**
- Git version control workflow
- Database design principles
- REST API design patterns
- Frontend-backend integration
- Testing methodologies

## **Assessment Opportunities**

This project provides multiple assessment touchpoints:
- **Database Design Review**: Schema correctness and relationship implementation
- **API Functionality**: Endpoint completeness and proper HTTP conventions
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- **User Interface**: Intuitive and functional frontend implementation
- **Integration Testing**: Seamless interaction between all application tiers

## **Learning Outcomes**

Upon completion, students will be able to:
1. **Model complex data relationships** and translate them into working database schemas
2. **Build production-ready REST APIs** that follow industry best practices
3. **Create full-stack applications** with proper separation of concerns
4. **Implement comprehensive CRUD operations** across multiple application layers
5. **Design user interfaces** that effectively present hierarchical data
6. **Integrate multiple technologies** into cohesive application solutions

## **Instructor Notes**

This project bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application development. Students will encounter real-world challenges including data validation, error handling, and user experience design. The modular structure allows for differentiated instruction - advanced students can explore additional features while others focus on core requirements.

The project's flexibility in domain selection (Customer-Orders, Course-Students, etc.) allows students to work with data models that interest them personally, increasing engagement and ownership of their learning.

**Recommended Support Strategy**: Daily check-ins during each phase to ensure students stay on track, with particular attention to the database design phase as it forms the foundation for all subsequent work.
